Javascript Trivia Game

This is a trivia game app which uses javascript intervals to create a trivia quiz which is timed and graded.

The key to this project was understanding jQuerie's .each and "this" to be able to iterate through the quiz questions
and decide whether the answer had the value assigned "correct" and finally calculate the number correct, incorrect and unanswered.
